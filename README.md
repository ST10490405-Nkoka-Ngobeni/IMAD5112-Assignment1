I developed an innovative Android app using Kotlin in Android Studio that helps users decide what to eat based on the time of day, by suggesting specific meals for specific times of the day. It does so by allowing users to enter a specific time of their day, such as "Afternoon, Mid-Afternoon etc", and then suggests a suitable meal for that Part of day.

App Features:
1. EditText for users to input the Part of day
2. Submit Button to process the input
3. TextView to display the meal suggestion
4. Reset Button to reset the input and output

This app is designed to assist individuals who struggle with meal choices throughout the day.


Utilising GitHub
To manage our project using Git Bash, we will first close all projects in GitHub, then select the specific app we are working on. This will open the project’s files in File Explorer, where we will launch Git Bash.When GitBash is now open we have to command the following:

1. git init
2. git add.
3. git commit -m "First Commit"
4. git remote add origin <repository_link>
5. git push origin main
6. git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
7. git push origin main

When you're done with the commands you've now have submitted on GitHub
